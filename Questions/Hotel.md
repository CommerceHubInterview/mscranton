### Problem Statement
CommerceHub has a partner that owns a hotel. Hotels are definitely not our business, but this is a good partner, so we want to do our best to help them out. The hotel currently has no online presence whatsoever, and they currently only take reservations over the phone. The hotel owner wants to expand their capabilities, and is asking for us to design a system that allows customers to make hotel reservations online. Before the engineers begin building the web app, you have been asked to design how to store and structure the reservation data.

The product manager has told you the following details to consider:
1. The hotel only has one location
2. All rooms are identical except for the bed type. The hotel describes their rooms as "King-sized" and "Queen-sized." There are 200 rooms total - 100 of each type.
3. The hotel only collects name, phone number, and email.
4. A customer can only book one hotel room at a time.
5. Payment is not collected until the time of checkout. You do not need to build tables to capture this data.
6. Pricing is as follows: King-size rooms are priced at X, Queen-size rooms are priced at Y. Prices are consistent all year. There will be no sales, discounts, or frequent stay programs.
